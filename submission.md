# Submission for the Labs Open Media Bounties

## Project Name
Honest Media

## Project Summary
An honest reporting platform where Journalists/Reporters/Writers will stake on their content. The content will be uploaded to IPFS. A reader can challenge the authenticity of the content (with proof) and stake on it. If the reader wins the challenge the amount staked by the Journalist will be rewarded to him and the validators ruling on the challenge. The Journalistâ€™s reputation rating will be affected. If the reader loses the challenge the amount staked by the reader will be rewarded to the Journalist and the validators.

Credibility and reputation of the Journalist will be built by the number of upvotes, downvotes they receive and challenges lost.
